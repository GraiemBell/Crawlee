/**
 * This example demonstrates how to use [`PuppeteerCrawler`](../api/puppeteercrawler)
 * in combination with [`RequestList`](../api/requestlist)
 * and [`RequestQueue`](../api/requestqueue) to recursively scrape the
 * <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Hacker News website</a> using headless Chrome / Puppeteer.
 * The crawler starts with a single URL, finds links to next pages,
 * enqueues them and continues until no more desired links are available.
 * The results are stored to the default dataset. In local configuration, the results are stored as JSON files in `./apify_storage/datasets/default`
 *
 * To run this example on the Apify Platform, select the `Node.js 8 + Chrome on Debian (apify/actor-node-chrome)` base image
 * on the source tab of your actor configuration.
