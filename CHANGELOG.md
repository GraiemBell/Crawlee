0.21.0 / 2020/06/06
====================
This release comes with **breaking changes** that will affect most,
if not all of your projects. See the [migration guide](https://github.com/apifytech/apify-js/blob/master/MIGRATIONS.md)
for more information and examples.

First large change is a redesigned proxy configuration. `Cheerio` and `Puppeteer` crawlers
now accept a `proxyConfiguration` parameter, which is an instance of `ProxyConfiguration`.
This class now exclusively manages both Apify Proxy and custom proxies. Visit the new
[proxy management guide](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/guides/proxy-management)

We also removed `Apify.utils.getRandomUserAgent()` as it was no longer effective
in avoiding bot detection and changed the default values for empty properties in
`Request` instances.

- **BREAKING:** Removed `Apify.getApifyProxyUrl()`. To get an Apify Proxy url,
  use `proxyConfiguration.newUrl([sessionId])`.
- **BREAKING:** Removed `useApifyProxy`, `apifyProxyGroups` and `apifyProxySession` parameters
  from all applications in the SDK. Use `proxyConfiguration` in crawlers and `proxyUrl`
  in `requestAsBrowser` and `Apify.launchPuppeteer`.
- **BREAKING:** Removed `Apify.utils.getRandomUserAgent()` as it was no longer effective
  in avoiding bot detection.
- **BREAKING:** `Request` instances no longer initialize empty properties with `null`,
  which means that:
    - empty `errorMessages` are now represented by `[]`, and
    - empty `loadedUrl`, `payload` and `handledAt` are `undefined`.
- Add `Apify.createProxyConfiguration()` `async` function to create `ProxyConfiguration`
  instances. `ProxyConfiguration` itself is not exposed.
- Add `proxyConfiguration` to `CheerioCrawlerOptions`
  and `PuppeteerCrawlerOptions`.
- Add `proxyInfo` to `CheerioHandlePageInputs` and `PuppeteerHandlePageInputs`.
  You can use this object to retrieve information about the currently used proxy
  in `Puppeteer` and `Cheerio` crawlers.
- Add click buttons and scroll up options to `Apify.utils.puppeteer.infiniteScroll()`.
- Fixed a bug where intercepted requests would never continue.
- Fixed a bug where `Apify.utils.requestAsBrowser()` would get into redirect loops.
- Fix `Apify.utils.getMemoryInfo()` crashing the process on AWS Lambda and on systems
  running in Docker without memory cgroups enabled.
- Update Puppeteer to 3.3.0.

0.20.4 / 2020-05-11
====================
- Add `Apify.utils.waitForRunToFinish()` which simplifies waiting for an actor run to finish.
- Add standard prefixes to log messages to improve readability and orientation in logs.
- Add support for `async` handlers in `Apify.utils.puppeteer.addInterceptRequestHandler()`
- EXPERIMENTAL: Add `cheerioCrawler.use()` function to enable attaching `CrawlerExtension`
  to the crawler to modify its behavior. A plugin that extends functionality.
- Fix bug with cookie expiry in `SessionPool`.
- Fix issues in documentation.
- Updated `@apify/http-request` to fix issue in the `proxy-agent` package.
- Updated Puppeteer to 3.0.2

0.20.3 / 2020-04-14
====================
- **DEPRECATED:** `CheerioCrawlerOptions.requestOptions` is now deprecated. Please use
  `CheerioCrawlerOptions.prepareRequestFunction` instead.
- Add `limit` option to `Apify.utils.enqueueLinks()` for situations when full crawls are not needed.
- Add `suggestResponseEncoding` and `forceResponseEncoding` options to `CheerioCrawler` to allow
  users to provide a fall-back or forced encoding of responses in situations where websites
  serve invalid encoding information in their headers.
- Add a number of new examples and update existing ones to documentation.
- Fix duplicate file extensions in `Apify.utils.puppeteer.saveSnapshot()` when used locally.
- Fix encoding of multi-byte characters in `CheerioCrawler`.
- Fix formatting of navigation buttons in documentation.

0.20.2 / 2020-03-09
====================
- Fix an error where persistence of `SessionPool` would fail if a cookie included invalid
  `expires` value.
- Jumping a patch version because of an error in publishing via CI.

0.20.0 / 2020-03-03
====================
- **BREAKING:** `Apify.utils.requestAsBrowser()` no longer aborts request on status code 406
  or when other than `text/html` type is received. Use `options.abortFunction` if you want to
  retain this functionality.
- **BREAKING:** Added `useInsecureHttpParser` option to `Apify.utils.requestAsBrowser()` which
  is `true` by default and forces the function to use a HTTP parser that is less strict than
  default Node 12 parser, but also less secure. It is needed to be able to bypass certain
  anti-scraping walls and fetch websites that do not comply with HTTP spec.
- **BREAKING:** `RequestList` now removes all the elements from the `sources` array on
  initialization. If you need to use the sources somewhere else, make a copy. This change
  was added as one of several measures to improve memory management of `RequestList`
  in scenarios with very large amount of `Request` instances.
- **DEPRECATED:** `RequestListOptions.persistSourcesKey` is now deprecated. Please use
  `RequestListOptions.persistRequestsKey`.
- `RequestList.sources` can now be an array of `string` URLs as well.
- Added `sourcesFunction` to `RequestListOptions`. It enables dynamic fetching of sources
  and will only be called if persisted `Requests` were not retrieved from key-value store.
  Use it to reduce memory spikes and also to make sure that your sources are not re-created
  on actor restarts.
- Updated `stealth` hiding of `webdriver` to avoid recent detections.
- `Apify.utils.log` now points to an updated logger instance which prints colored logs (in TTY)
  and supports overriding with custom loggers.
- Improved `Apify.launchPuppeteer()` code to prevent triggering bugs in Puppeteer by passing
  more than required options to `puppeteer.launch()`.
- Documented `BasicCrawler.autoscaledPool` property, and added `CheerioCrawler.autoscaledPool`
  and `PuppeteerCrawler.autoscaledPool` properties.
- `SessionPool` now persists state on `teardown`. Before, it only persisted state every minute.
  This ensures that after a crawler finishes, the state is correctly persisted.
- Added TypeScript typings and typedef documentation for all entities used throughout SDK.
- Upgraded `proxy-chain` NPM package from 0.2.7 to 0.4.1 and many other dependencies
- Removed all usage of the now deprecated `request` package.

0.19.1 / 2020-01-30

====================
- **BREAKING**: `APIFY_LOCAL_EMULATION_DIR` env var is no longer supported (deprecated on 2018-09-11).
  Use `APIFY_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR` instead.
- `SessionPool` API updates and fixes. The API is no longer considered experimental.
- Logging of system info moved from `require` time to `Apify.main()` invocation.
- Use native `RegExp` instead of `xregexp` for unicode property escapes.

0.18.1 / 2020-01-06
====================
- Fix `SessionPool` not automatically working in `CheerioCrawler`.
- Fix incorrect management of page count in `PuppeteerPool`.

0.18.0 / 2020-01-06
====================
- **BREAKING** `CheerioCrawler` ignores ssl errors by default - `options.ignoreSslErrors: true`.
- Add `SessionPool` implemenation to `CheerioCrawler`.
- Add `SessionPool` implementation to `PuppeteerPool` and `PupeteerCrawler`.
- Fix `Request` constructor not making a copy of objects such as `userData` and `headers`.
- Fix `desc` option not being applied in local `dataset.getData()`.

0.17.0 / 2019-11-25
====================
- **BREAKING**: Node 8 and 9 are no longer supported. Please use Node 10.17.0 or higher.
- **DEPRECATED**: `Apify.callTask()` `body` and `contentType` options are now deprecated.
  Use `input` instead. It must be of `content-type: application/json`.
- Add default `SessionPool` implementation to `BasicCrawler`.
- Add the ability to create ad-hoc webhooks via `Apify.call()` and `Apify.callTask()`.
- Add an example of form filling with `Puppeteer`.
- Add `country` option to `Apify.getApifyProxyUrl()`.
- Add `Apify.utils.puppeteer.saveSnapshot()` helper to quickly save HTML and screenshot of a page.
- Add the ability to pass `got` supported options to `requestOptions` in `CheerioCrawler`
  thus supporting things such as `cookieJar` again.
- Switch Puppeteer to web socket again due to suspected `pipe` errors.
- Fix an issue where some encodings were not correctly parsed in `CheerioCrawler`.
- Fix parsing bad Content-Type headers for `CheerioCrawler`.

- Fix `Apify.utils.puppeteer.blockRequests()` always including default patterns.
- Fix inconsistent behavior of `Apify.utils.puppeteer.infiniteScroll()` on some websites.
- Fix retry histogram statistics sometimes showing invalid counts.
- Added regexps for Youtube videos (`YOUTUBE_REGEX`, `YOUTUBE_REGEX_GLOBAL`) to `utils.social`
- Added documentation for option `json` in handlePageFunction of `CheerioCrawler`

0.16.1 / 2019-10-31
====================
- Bump Puppeteer to 2.0.0 and use `{ pipe: true }` again because upstream bug has been fixed.
- Add `useIncognitoPages` option to `PuppeteerPool` to enable opening new pages in incognito
  browser contexts. This is useful to keep cookies and cache unique for each page.
- Added options to load every content type in CheerioCrawler.
There are new options `body` and `contentType` in `handlePageFunction` for this purposes.
- **DEPRECATED**: CheerioCrawler `html` option in `handlePageFunction` was replaced with `body` options.

0.16.0 / 2019-08-15
====================
- This release updates `@apify/http-request` to version 1.1.2.
- Update `CheerioCrawler` to use `requestAsBrowser()` to better disguise as a real browser.


0.15.5 / 2019-08-15
====================
- This release just updates some dependencies (not Puppeteer).

0.15.4 / 2019-08-02
====================
- **DEPRECATED**: `dataset.delete()`, `keyValueStore.delete()` and `requestQueue.delete()` methods have been
  deprecated in favor of `*.drop()` methods, because the `drop` name more clearly communicates the fact
  that those methods drop / delete the storage itself, not individual elements in the storage.
- Added `Apify.utils.requestAsBrowser()` helper function that enables you to make HTTP(S) requests disguising
  as a browser (Firefox). This may help in overcoming certain anti-scraping and anti-bot protections.
- Added `options.gotoTimeoutSecs` to `PuppeteerCrawler` to enable easier setting of navigation timeouts.
- `PuppeteerPool` options that were deprecated from the `PuppeteerCrawler` constructor were finally removed.
  Please use `maxOpenPagesPerInstance`, `retireInstanceAfterRequestCount`, `instanceKillerIntervalSecs`,
  `killInstanceAfterSecs` and `proxyUrls` via the `puppeteerPoolOptions` object.
- On the Apify Platform a warning will now be printed when using an outdated `apify` package version.
- `Apify.utils.puppeteer.enqueueLinksByClickingElements()` will now print a warning when the nodes it
  tries to click become modified (detached from DOM). This is useful to debug unexpected behavior.

0.15.3 / 2019-07-29
====================
- `Apify.launchPuppeteer()` now accepts `proxyUrl` with the `https`, `socks4`
  and `socks5` schemes, as long as it doesn't contain username or password.
  This is to fix [Issue #420](https://github.com/apifytech/apify-js/issues/420).
- Added `desiredConcurrency` option to `AutoscaledPool` constructor, removed
  unnecessary bound check from the setter property

0.15.2 / 2019-07-11
====================
- Fix error where Puppeteer would fail to launch when pipes are turned off.
- Switch back to default Web Socket transport for Puppeteer due to upstream issues.

0.15.1 / 2019-07-09

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `Dataset.getData()` throws an error if user provides an unsupported option
  when using local disk storage.
- **DEPRECATED**: `options.userData` of `Apify.utils.enqueueLinks()` is deprecated.
  Use `options.transformRequestFunction` instead.
- Improve logging of memory overload errors.
- Improve error message in `Apify.call()`.
- Fix multiple log lines appearing when a crawler was about to finish.
- Add `Apify.utils.puppeteer.enqueueLinksByClickingElements()` function which enables you
  to add requests to the queue from pure JavaScript navigations, form submissions etc.
- Add `Apify.utils.puppeteer.infiniteScroll()` function which helps you with scrolling to the bottom
  of websites that auto-load new content.
- The `RequestQueue.handledCount()` function has been resurrected from deprecation,
  in order to have compatible interface with `RequestList`.
- Add `useExtendedUniqueKey` option to `Request` constructor to include `method` and `payload`
  in the `Request`'s computed `uniqueKey`.
- Updated Puppeteer to 1.18.1
- Updated `apify-client` to 0.5.22


0.14.15 / 2019-05-31
====================
- Fixes in `RequestQueue` to deal with inconsistencies in the underlying data storage
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `RequestQueue.addRequest()` now sets the ID of the
  newly added request to the passed `Request` object
- The `RequestQueue.handledCount()` function has been deprecated,
  please use `RequestQueue.getInfo()` instead.

0.14.14 / 2019-05-30
====================

0.14.12 / 2019-05-29
====================
- `Snapshotter` will now log critical memory overload warnings at most once per 10 seconds.
- Live view snapshots are now made right after navigation finishes, instead of right before page close.

0.14.11 / 2019-05-28
====================
- Add `Statistics` class to track crawler run statistics.
- Use pipes instead of web sockets in Puppeteer to improve performance and stability.
- Add warnings to all functions using Puppeteer's request interception to inform users about
  its performance impact caused by automatic cache disabling.
- **DEPRECATED**: `Apify.utils.puppeteer.blockResources()` because of negative impact on performance.
  Use `.blockRequests()` (see below).
- Add `Apify.utils.puppeteer.blockRequests()` to enable blocking URL patterns without request interception involved.
  This is a replacement for `.blockResources()` until performance issues with request interception resolve.


0.14.10 / 2019-05-24
====================
- Update `Puppeteer` to 1.17.0.
- Add `idempotencyKey` parameter to `Apify.addWebhook()`.

0.14.9 / 2019-05-22
===================
- Better logs from `AutoscaledPool` class
- Replace `cpuInfo` Apify event with new `systemInfo` event in `Snapshotter`.

  now also supports functions via `func.toString()`. The same holds for record body in `setValue()`
  method of key-value store.
- Request queue now monitors number of clients that accessed the queue which allows crawlers to finish
  without 10s waiting if run was not migrated during its lifetime.


0.14.5 / 2019-05-06
===================
- Update Puppeteer to 1.15.0.

0.14.4 / 2019-05-06
===================
- Added the `stealth` option `launchPuppeteerOptions` which decreases headless browser detection chance.
- **DEPRECATED**: `Apify.utils.puppeteer.hideWebDriver` use `launchPuppeteerOptions.stealth` instead.
- `CheerioCrawler` now parses HTML using streams. This improves performance and memory usage in most cases.

0.14.3 / 2019-05-06
===================
- Request queue now allows crawlers to finish quickly without waiting in a case that queue was used by a single client.
- Better logging of errors in `Apify.main()`

===================
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Live View is no longer available by passing `liveView = true` to `launchPuppeteerOptions`.
- New version of Live View is available by passing the `useLiveView = true` option to `PuppeteerPool`.
   - Only shows snapshots of a single page from a single browser.
   - Only makes snapshots when a client is connected, having very low performance impact otherwise.
- Added `Apify.utils.puppeteer.addInterceptRequestHandler` and `removeInterceptRequestHandler` which
  can be used to add multiple request interception handlers to Puppeteer's pages.
- Added `puppeteerModule` to `LaunchPuppeteerOptions` which enables use of other Puppeteer modules,
  such as `puppeteer-extra` instead of plain `puppeteer`.

0.13.7 / 2019-04-04
===================
- Fix a bug where invalid response from `RequestQueue` would occasionally cause crawlers to crash.

0.13.5 / 2019-03-27
===================
- Fix `RequestQueue` throttling at high concurrency.

0.13.4 / 2019-03-26
===================
- Fix bug in `addWebhook` invocation.

- Fix `puppeteerPoolOptions` object not being used in `PuppeteerCrawler`.

0.13.2 / 2019-03-21
===================
- Fix `REQUEST_QUEUE_HEAD_MAX_LIMIT` is not defined error.

0.13.1 / 2019-03-21
===================
- `Snapshotter` now marks Apify Client overloaded on the basis of 2nd retry errors.
- Added `Apify.addWebhook()` to invoke a webhook when an actor run ends.
  Currently this only works on the Apify Platform and will print a warning when ran locally.

0.13.0 / 2019-03-14
===================
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Added `puppeteerOperationTimeoutSecs` option to `PuppeteerPool`.
  It defaults to 15 seconds and all Puppeteer operations such as `browser.newPage()`
  or `puppeteer.launch()` will now time out. This is to prevent hanging requests.
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Added `handleRequestTimeoutSecs` option to `BasicCrawler` with a 60 second default.
- **DEPRECATED:** `PuppeteerPool` options in the `PuppeteerCrawler` constructor are now deprecated.
  Please use the new `puppeteerPoolOptions` argument of type `Object` to pass them. `launchPuppeteerFunction`
  and `launchPuppeteerOptions` are still available as shortcuts for convenience.
- `CheerioCrawler` and `PuppeteerCrawler` now automatically set `handleRequestTimeoutSecs` to 10 times
  their `handlePageTimeoutSecs`. This is a precaution that should keep requests from hanging forever.
- Added `options.prepareRequestFunction()` to `CheerioCrawler` constructor to enable modification
  of `Request` before the HTTP request is made to the target URL.
- Added back the `recycleDiskCache` option to `PuppeteerPool` now that it is supported
  even in headless mode ([read more](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=882431))

0.12.4 / 2019-03-05
===================
- Parameters `input` and `options` added to `Apify.callTask()`.

0.12.2 / 2019-02-27
===================
- Added oldest active tab focusing to `PuppeteerPool` to combat resource throttling in Chromium.

0.12.1 / 2019-02-27
===================
- Added `Apify.metamorph()`, see documentation for more information.
- Added `Apify.getInput()`

0.12.0 / 2019-02-25
===================
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Reduced default `handlePageTimeoutSecs` for both `CheerioCrawler` and `PuppeteerCrawler` from 300 to 60 seconds,
  in order to prevent stalling crawlers.
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** `PseudoUrl` now performs case-insensitive matching, even for the query string part of the URLs.
  If you need case sensitive matching, use an appropriate `RegExp` in place of a Pseudo URL string
- **Upgraded to puppeteer@1.12.2** and xregexp@4.2.4
- Added `loadedUrl` property to `Request` that contains the final URL of the loaded page after all redirects.
- Added memory overload warning log message.
- Added `keyValueStore.getPublicUrl` function.
- Added `minConcurrency`, `maxConcurrency`, `desiredConcurrency`
  and `currentConcurrency` properties to `AutoscaledPool`, improved docs
- Deprecated `AutoscaledPool.setMinConcurrency` and `AutoscaledPool.setMaxConcurrency` functions
- Updated `DEFAULT_USER_AGENT` and `USER_AGENT_LIST` with new User Agents
- Bugfix: `LocalRequestQueue.getRequest()` threw an exception if request was not found
- Added `RequestQueue.getInfo()` function
- Improved `Apify.main()` to provide nicer stack traces on errors
- `Apify.utils.puppeteer.injectFile()` now supports injection that survives page navigations and caches file contents.

===================
- Fix the `keyValueStore.forEachKey()` method.
- Fix version of `puppeteer` to prevent errors with automatic updates.

0.11.7 / 2019-01-30
===================
- Apify SDK now logs basic system info when `required`.
- Added `utils.createRequestDebugInfo()` function to create a standardized debug info from request and response.
- `PseudoUrl` can now be constructed with a `RegExp`.
- `Apify.utils.enqueueLinks()` now accepts `RegExp` instances in its `pseudoUrls` parameter.
- `Apify.utils.enqueueLinks()` now accepts a `baseUrl` option that enables resolution of relative URLs
   when parsing a Cheerio object. (It's done automatically in browser when using Puppeteer).
- Better error message for an invalid `launchPuppeteerFunction` passed to `PuppeteerPool`.

0.11.6 / 2019-01-24
===================
- **DEPRECATION WARNING** `Apify.utils.puppeteer.enqueueLinks()` was moved to `Apify.utils.enqueueLinks()`.
- `Apify.utils.enqueueLinks()` now supports `options.$` property to enqueue links from a Cheerio object.

0.11.5 / 2019-01-18
===================
- Disabled the `PuppeteerPool` `reusePages` option for now, due to a memory leak.
- Added a `keyValueStore.forEachKey()` method to iterate all keys in the store.

0.11.4 / 2019-01-15
===================
- Improvements in `Apify.utils.social.parseHandlesFromHtml` and `Apify.utils.htmlToText`
- Updated docs

0.11.3 / 2019-01-10
===================
- Fix `reusePages` causing Puppeteer to fail when used together with request interception.

0.11.2 / 2019-01-10
===================
- Fix missing `reusePages` configuration parameter in `PuppeteerCrawler`.
- Fix a memory leak where `reusePages` would prevent browsers from closing.

0.11.1 / 2019-01-07
===================
- Fix missing `autoscaledPool` parameter in `handlePageFunction` of `PuppeteerCrawler`.

0.11.0 / 2019-01-07
===================
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** `basicCrawler.abort()`, `cheerioCrawler.abort()` and `puppeteerCrawler.abort()` functions
  were removed in favor of a single `autoscaledPool.abort()` function.

- Added a reference to the running `AutoscaledPool` instance to the options object of `BasicCrawler`'s
  `handleRequestFunction` and to the `handlePageFunction` of `CheerioCrawler` and `PuppeteerCrawler`.
- Added sources persistence option to `RequestList` that works best in conjunction with the state persistence,
  but can be toggled separately too.
- Added `Apify.openRequestList()` function to place it in line with `RequestQueue`, `KeyValueStore` and `Dataset`.
  `RequestList` created using this function will automatically persist state and sources.
- Added `pool.pause()` and `pool.resume()` functions to `AutoscaledPool`. You can now pause the pool,
  which will prevent additional tasks from being run and wait for the running ones to finish.
- Fixed a memory leak in `CheerioCrawler` and potentially other crawlers.

0.10.2 / 2018-12-30
===================
- Added `Apify.utils.htmlToText()` function to convert HTML to text and removed unncessary `html-to-text` dependency.
  The new function is now used in `Apify.utils.social.parseHandlesFromHtml()`.
- Updated `DEFAULT_USER_AGENT`

0.10.0 / 2018-12-19
===================
- `autoscaledPool.isFinishedFunction()` and `autoscaledPool.isTaskReadyFunction()` exceptions
  will now cause the `Promise` returned by `autoscaledPool.run()` to reject instead of just
  logging a message. This is in line with the `autoscaledPool.runTaskFunction()` behavior.
- Bugfix: PuppeteerPool was incorrectly overriding `proxyUrls` even if they were not defined.
- Fixed an issue where an error would be thrown when `datasetLocal.getData()` was invoked
  with an overflowing offset. It now correctly returns an empty `Array`.
- Added the `reusePages` option to `PuppeteerPool`. It will now reuse existing tabs
  instead of opening new ones for each page when enabled.
- `BasicCrawler` (and therefore all Crawlers) now logs a message explaining why it finished.
- Fixed an issue where `maxRequestsPerCrawl` option would not be honored after restart or migration.
- Fixed an issue with timeout promises that would sometimes keep the process hanging.
- `CheerioCrawler` now accepts `gzip` and `deflate` compressed responses.

0.9.15 / 2018-11-30
===================
- Upgraded Puppeteer to 1.11.0
- **DEPRECATION WARNING:** `Apify.utils.puppeteer.enqueueLinks()` now uses an options object instead of individual parameters
  and supports passing of `userData` to the enqueued `request`. Previously: `enqueueLinks(page, selector, requestQueue, pseudoUrls)`
  Now: `enqueueLinks({ page, selector, requestQueue, pseudoUrls, userData })`. Using individual parameters is **DEPRECATED**.

0.9.14 / 2018-11-27
===================
- Added API response tracking to AutoscaledPool, leveraging `Apify.client.stats` object. It now overloads the system
  when a large amount of  429 - Too Many Requests is received.

0.9.13 / 2018-11-26
===================
- Updated NPM packages to fix a vulnerability reported at https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/issues/116

0.9.12 / 2018-11-26
===================
- Added warning if the Node.js is an older version that doesn't support regular expression syntax used by the tools in
  the `Apify.utils.social` namespace, instead of failing to start.

0.9.11 / 2018-11-26
===================
- Added back support for `memory` option in `Apify.call()`, write deprecation warning instead of silently failing

0.9.10 / 2018-11-24
===================
- Improvements in `Apify.utils.social` functions and tests

0.9.8 / 2018-11-24
==================
- Added new `Apify.utils.social` namespace with function to extract emails, phone and social profile URLs
  from HTML and text documents. Specifically, it supports Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and Facebook profiles.
- Updated NPM dependencies

0.9.7 / 2018-11-20
==================
- `Apify.launchPuppeteer()` now sets the `defaultViewport` option if not provided by user,
