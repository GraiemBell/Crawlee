/**
 * Provides a simple framework for parallel crawling of web pages.
 * The URLs to crawl are fed either from a static list of URLs
 * or from a dynamic queue of URLs enabling recursive crawling of websites.
 *
 * `BasicCrawler` is a low-level tool that requires the user to implement the page
 * download and data extraction functionality themselves.
 * If you want a crawler that already facilitates this functionality,
 * please consider using {@link PuppeteerCrawler} or {@link CheerioCrawler}.
 *
 * `BasicCrawler` invokes the user-provided [`handleRequestFunction()`](#new_BasicCrawler_new)
 * for each {@link Request} object, which represents a single URL to crawl.
 * The {@link Request} objects are fed from the {@link RequestList} or the {@link RequestQueue}
 * instances provided by the [`requestList`](#new_BasicCrawler_new) or [`requestQueue`](#new_BasicCrawler_new)
 * constructor options, respectively.
 *
 * If both [`requestList`](#new_BasicCrawler_new) and [`requestQueue`](#new_BasicCrawler_new) options are used,
 * the instance first processes URLs from the {@link RequestList} and automatically enqueues all of them
 * to {@link RequestQueue} before it starts their processing. This ensures that a single URL is not crawled multiple times.
 *
 * The crawler finishes if there are no more {@link Request} objects to crawl.
 *
 * New requests are only dispatched when there is enough free CPU and memory available,
 * using the functionality provided by the {@link AutoscaledPool} class.
 * All {@link AutoscaledPool} configuration options can be passed to the `autoscaledPoolOptions`
 * parameter of the `BasicCrawler` constructor. For user convenience, the `minConcurrency` and `maxConcurrency`
 * {@link AutoscaledPool} options are available directly in the `BasicCrawler` constructor.
 *
 * **Example usage:**
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const rp = require('request-promise-native');
 *
 * // Prepare a list of URLs to crawl
 * const requestList = new Apify.RequestList({
 *   sources: [
 *       { url: 'http://www.example.com/page-1' },
 *       { url: 'http://www.example.com/page-2' },
 *   ],
 * });
 * await requestList.initialize();
 *
 * // Crawl the URLs
 * const crawler = new Apify.BasicCrawler({
 *     requestList,
 *     handleRequestFunction: async ({ request }) => {
 *         // 'request' contains an instance of the Request class
 *         // Here we simply fetch the HTML of the page and store it to a dataset
 *         await Apify.pushData({
 *             url: request.url,
 *             html: await rp(request.url),
 *         })
 *     },
 * });
 *
 * await crawler.run();
 * ```
 *
 * @property {AutoscaledPool} autoscaledPool
 *  A reference to the underlying {@link AutoscaledPool} class that manages the concurrency of the crawler.
 *  Note that this property is only initialized after calling the {@link BasicCrawler#run} function.
 *  You can use it to change the concurrency settings on the fly,
 *  to pause the crawler by calling {@link AutoscaledPool#pause}
 *  or to abort it by calling {@link AutoscaledPool#abort}.
