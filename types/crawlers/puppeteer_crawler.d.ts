/**
 * Provides a simple framework for parallel crawling of web pages
 * using headless Chrome with <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer" target="_blank">Puppeteer</a>.
 * The URLs to crawl are fed either from a static list of URLs
 * or from a dynamic queue of URLs enabling recursive crawling of websites.
 *
 * Since `PuppeteerCrawler` uses headless Chrome to download web pages and extract data,
 * it is useful for crawling of websites that require to execute JavaScript.
 * If the target website doesn't need JavaScript, consider using {@link CheerioCrawler},
 * which downloads the pages using raw HTTP requests and is about 10x faster.
 *
 * The source URLs are represented using {@link Request} objects that are fed from
 * {@link RequestList} or {@link RequestQueue} instances provided by the [`requestList`](#new_PuppeteerCrawler_new)
 * or [`requestQueue`](#new_PuppeteerCrawler_new) constructor options, respectively.
 *
 * If both [`requestList`](#new_PuppeteerCrawler_new) and [`requestQueue`](#new_PuppeteerCrawler_new) are used,
 * the instance first processes URLs from the {@link RequestList} and automatically enqueues all of them
 * to {@link RequestQueue} before it starts their processing. This ensures that a single URL is not crawled multiple times.
 *
 * The crawler finishes when there are no more {@link Request} objects to crawl.
 *
 * `PuppeteerCrawler` opens a new Chrome page (i.e. tab) for each {@link Request} object to crawl
 * and then calls the function provided by user as the [`handlePageFunction()`](#new_PuppeteerCrawler_new) option.
 *
 * New pages are only opened when there is enough free CPU and memory available,
 * using the functionality provided by the {@link AutoscaledPool} class.
 * All {@link AutoscaledPool} configuration options can be passed to the `autoscaledPoolOptions`
 * parameter of the `PuppeteerCrawler` constructor. For user convenience, the `minConcurrency` and `maxConcurrency`
 * {@link AutoscaledPool} options are available directly in the `PuppeteerCrawler` constructor.
 *
 * Note that the pool of Puppeteer instances is internally managed by
 * the {@link PuppeteerPool} class. Many constructor options
 * such as `maxOpenPagesPerInstance` or `launchPuppeteerFunction` are passed directly
 * to {@link PuppeteerPool} constructor.
 *
 * **Example usage:**
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const crawler = new Apify.PuppeteerCrawler({
 *     requestList,
 *     handlePageFunction: async ({ page, request }) => {
 *         // This function is called to extract data from a single web page
 *         // 'page' is an instance of Puppeteer.Page with page.goto(request.url) already called
 *         // 'request' is an instance of Request class with information about the page to load
 *         await Apify.pushData({
 *             title: await page.title(),
 *             url: request.url,
 *             succeeded: true,
 *         })
 *     },
 *     handleFailedRequestFunction: async ({ request }) => {
 *         // This function is called when the crawling of a request failed too many times
 *         await Apify.pushData({
 *             url: request.url,
 *             succeeded: false,
 *             errors: request.errorMessages,
 *         })
 *     },
 * });
 *
 * await crawler.run();
 * ```
 * @property {AutoscaledPool} autoscaledPool
 *  A reference to the underlying {@link AutoscaledPool} class that manages the concurrency of the crawler.
 *  Note that this property is only initialized after calling the {@link PuppeteerCrawler#run} function.
 *  You can use it to change the concurrency settings on the fly,
 *  to pause the crawler by calling {@link AutoscaledPool#pause}
 *  or to abort it by calling {@link AutoscaledPool#abort}.
