/**
 * `LiveViewServer` enables serving of browser snapshots via web sockets. It includes its own client
 * that provides a simple frontend to viewing the captured snapshots. A snapshot consists of three
 * pieces of information, the currently opened URL, the content of the page (HTML) and its screenshot.
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *     "pageUrl": "https://www.example.com",
 *     "htmlContent": "<html><body> ....",
 *     "screenshotIndex": 3,
 *     "createdAt": "2019-04-18T11:50:40.060Z"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `LiveViewServer` is useful when you want to be able to inspect the current browser status on demand.
 * When no client is connected, the webserver consumes very low resources so it should have a close
 * to zero impact on performance. Only once a client connects the server will start serving snapshots.
 * Once no longer needed, it can be disabled again in the client to remove any performance impact.
 *
 * NOTE: Screenshot taking in browser typically takes around 300ms. So having the `LiveViewServer`
 * always serve snapshots will have a significant impact on performance.
 *
 * When using {@link PuppeteerPool}, the `LiveViewServer` can be
 * easily used just by providing the `useLiveView = true` option to the {@link PuppeteerPool}.
 * It can also be initiated via {@link PuppeteerCrawler} `puppeteerPoolOptions`.
 *
 * It will take snapshots of the first page of the latest browser. Taking snapshots of only a
 * single page improves performance and stability dramatically in high concurrency situations.
 *
 * When running locally, it is often best to use a headful browser for debugging, since it provides
 * a better view into the browser, including DevTools, but `LiveViewServer` works too.

     * @param {string} [options.screenshotDirectoryPath]
     *   By default, the screenshots are saved to

     *   its creation will be aborted. This is to prevent

     *   Use this parameter to further decrease the resource consumption
     *   of `LiveViewServer` by limiting the frequency at which it'll
     *   serve snapshots.
