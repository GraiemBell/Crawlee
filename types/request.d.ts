 * @property {string} url

 *   to be included.
 *
 *   When using {@link PuppeteerCrawler}, meta tag and JavaScript redirects may,
 *   or may not be included, depending on their nature. This generally means that redirects,
 *   which happen immediately will most likely be included, but delayed redirects will not.
 * @property {string} uniqueKey
 *   A unique key identifying the request.
 *   Two requests with the same `uniqueKey` are considered as pointing to the same URL.
 * @property {string} method
 *   HTTP method, e.g. `GET` or `POST`.
 * @property {(string|Buffer)} payload
 *   HTTP request payload, e.g. for POST requests.
 * @property {boolean} noRetry
 *   The `true` value indicates that the request will not be automatically retried on error.
 * @property {number} retryCount
 *   Indicates the number of times the crawling of the request has been retried on error.
 * @property {string[]} errorMessages
 *   An array of error messages from request processing.
 * @property {Object} headers
 *   Object with HTTP headers. Key is header name, value is the value.
 * @property {object} userData
 *   Custom user data assigned to the request.
 * @property {Date} handledAt
