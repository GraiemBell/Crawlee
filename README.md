The apify NPM package simplifies development of acts in Apify Actor - a serverless computing platform that enables execution of arbitrary pieces of code in the cloud. The package provides helper functions to launch web browsers with proxies, access the storage etc. Note that the usage of the package is optional, you can create acts without it.

Complete documentation of this package is available at https://www.apify.com/docs/sdk/apify-runtime-js/latest
