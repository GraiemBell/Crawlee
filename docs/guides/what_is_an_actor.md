title: What is an Actor
---

When you deploy your script to the [Apify Cloud](https://apify.com/), it becomes an actor. An actor is a serverless
microservice that accepts an input and produces an output. It can run for a few seconds, hours or even infinitely. An actor can perform anything from
a simple action such as filling out a web form or sending an email, to complex operations such as crawling an entire website and removing duplicates
from a large dataset.

To run an actor, you need to have an [Apify Account](https://my.apify.com/). Actors can be shared in the
[Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) so that other people can use them. But don't worry, if you share your actor in the
store and somebody uses it, it runs under their account, not yours.
