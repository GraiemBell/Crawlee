title: What is an Actor
---
When you deploy your script to the <a href="https://apify.com/" target="_blank">Apify Cloud</a>,
it becomes an actor.
An actor is a serverless microservice that accepts an input and produces an output.
It can run for a few seconds, hours or even infinitely.
An actor can perform anything from a simple action such as filling out a web form or sending an email,
to complex operations such as crawling an entire website and removing duplicates from a large dataset.

To run an actor, you need to have an <a href="https://my.apify.com/)" target="_blank">Apify Account</a>.
Actors can be shared in the <a href="https://apify.com/library?&type=acts)" target="_blank">Apify Library</a>
so that other people can use them.
But don't worry, if you share your actor in the library
and somebody uses it, it runs under their account, not yours.
