/*
The main entry point of the docker action.

The following env variables are available:
- ACTIONS_TOKEN - required; a GitHub PAT
- CRAWLEE_BETA_VERSION - if set, the action will deploy to the beta channel, and for the specified crawlee version
- CUSTOM_DISPATCH_REPOSITORY - if set, the action will dispatch to the specified repository instead of apify/apify-actor-docker

Run with `bun run-ci` in the actions/docker-images directory.
